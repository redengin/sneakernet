SneakerNet App
================================================================================
Leverages [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to allow the app to run anywhere.

This implementation supports Android and iOS.

Getting Started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### To start development under `Android Studio`
* clone the full repos using your favorite git tool
    * if you are using `Android Studio` (*Project from Version Control*)
        * close the project and follow the following steps
* In `Android Studio Welcome` *Open* 'sneakernet/flutter'
    * initialize `Flutter` via *Tools>Flutter>Flutter Doctor*
        * set the *Flutter SDK path*

If `Flutter Doctor` fails to find the `jre`, you may have to
```sh
# in your android-studio directory
ln -s jbr jre
```
