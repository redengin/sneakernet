SneakerNet
================================================================================
SneakerNet is a physical implementation for [USENET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet)
a worldwide distributed discussion system.

SneakerNet nodes are inexpensive to create. By creating a SneakerNet node,
you increase access to information - to both yourself and people around you.

The SneakerNet App provides automated access to local USENET content.
By using the app, users distribute USENET content across SneakerNet nodes.
