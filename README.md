`SneakerNet`
================================================================================
With the `SneakerNet` app, users will be aware of locally published content.
`SneakerNet` works without use of the internet, providing a offline repository
of information.

### [The internet has diluted the sense of local community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_influences_on_communities)
Where the internet focuses on developing global platforms (facebook, nextdoor,
wechat, etc.) the community representation is largely segmented into a bubbles of
like-minded peers.

An analog is the [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/).  
Instead of a physical cabinet full of books, `SneakerNet` nodes provide digital
content (epub books, music, etc.) using inexpensive hardware (less than $20 USD).

For more information about the concept see [concept of operations](docs/conops.md).
