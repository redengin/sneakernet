Concept of Operations
================================================================================
<!-- main scenario -->
When a person enters into the physical space of a `SneakerNet` node, they will
be able to access the content stored on that node.


Human Factors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Awareness - the person must be made aware that the content is available
    * primarily this can be accomplished by an application installed on the
        phone that recognizes `SneakerNet` nodes
    * `SneakerNet` nodes can also publish themselves as a wifi connection
        - attracting those looking for internet connectivity

Ecosystem of `SneakerNet` (Roles)
================================================================================
* Reader - consumer of content
* Courier - carrier of content
    - provides `SneakerNet` content from multiple nodes
* Librarian - determines the content of a node
    - [content management](content_management)
* Distributor - deploys a physical device under the control of a librarian
* Content Creator - creates content
    - per [content management](content_management) there may need to be an
        acceptance by a `Content Publisher` for the content to be available.
* Content Publisher - 
    - `sign` content to support [content management](content_management)


Content Management<a id="content_management"></a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content is either
* uncontrolled - anything goes
* controlled - `signed` by a `Content Publisher`

The librarian is empowered to choose
* to allow `uncontrolled` content
* what `controlled` content they wish to make available

As `SneakerNet` is fully distributed, other librarians may provide the content
on their own nodes.

### What authority does the `Content Publisher` have?
None.  
The role of a `content publisher` is to forward content toward an audience.
`Content creators` requesting `signing` simply desire a greater audience.

Anonymity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content is art. Art inspires thought. The individual that produced that art
should be protected in their expression. Too often the motivation to thought, is
curtailed by call to action.

Action looks for a target.

`SneakerNet` implementation ensures anonymity of `content creator`.
