Concept of Operations
================================================================================
<!-- main scenario -->
When a person enters into the physical space of a SneakerNet node, they will
be able to access the content stored on that node.

Human Factors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Awareness - user must be made aware that the content is available
    * **primarily** accomplished via the mobile app that automatically
        synchronizes with SneakerNet nodes
    * provide an open wifi connection (attracting those looking for internet
        connectivity)
* Relevance - users want locally relevant content
    * each SneakerNet node's content is maintained by local users - able to
        add and remove content to maximize relevance (aka curation)

Roles
================================================================================
* **Reader** - content consumer
* **Curator** - removal of objectionable content from SneakerNet
* **Node Maintainer** - update of the SneakerNet node software

Curator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SneakerNet implementations ensure that every `reader` is able to take on the
`curator` role by deleting objectionable content from the node they are
connected to.

By using the **mobile application**, the flagged content will be automatically
removed upon connection to any SneakerNet node.

Node Maintainer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The **mobile application** will automatically upgrade node's software upon
connection.
