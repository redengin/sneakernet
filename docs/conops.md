Concept of Operations
================================================================================
<!-- main scenario -->
When a person enters into the physical space of a `SneakerNet` node, they will
be able to access the content stored on that node.

Human Factors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Awareness - the person must be made aware that the content is available
    * **primarily** this is accomplished by an application installed on the
        phone that recognizes `SneakerNet` nodes
    * `SneakerNet` nodes also publish themselves as an open wifi connection
        - attracting those looking for internet connectivity

Roles
================================================================================
* **Author** - creates content
* **Reader** - consumer of content
* **Courier** - carrier of content
    - **Readers** that use the `mobile app`, will automatically become couriers.  
        In this way, content is efficiently distributed.  
        Aditionally, the `mobile app` will carry **Firmware** to efficiently maintain `SneakerNet`.

Content Management<a id="content_management"></a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`SneakerNet` node content is both **addable** and **removable** by users.

Upon sync
* **Courier**'s content will be added to the `SneakerNet` node
* **Courier**'s flagged content will be removed from the `SneakerNet` node

By giving the **courier** both the ability to **add** and **remove** content,
the `SneakerNet` content will evolve by the social norms of the users.
