Concept of Operations
================================================================================

### Finding and Accessing a SneakerNet content
* **non-mobile app users**  
    When searching for wifi access, they will see the SneakerNet node's SSID.
    Upon choosing to connect to the SSID, they will be presented the webapp.

* **mobile app users**  
    The mobile app will constantly scan for SneakerNet node SSIDs. When a
    SneakerNet node is found, the mobile app will alert the user.  
    Additionally, the mobile app can automate interactions with the SneakerNet
    node (see [Content Management](#content-management))

### Content Management
SneakerNet is a [decentralized system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system).
SneakerNet content is **self-organized** by users.
* All users can **add content**.
* All users can **remove content**.

#### Offensive/Irrelevant Content
As a decentralized system, it is up to the users to remove such content.

To maximize the relevance of SneakerNet content, the removal of such content is
automated. Users flag such content, and upon interaction with each SneakerNet node
the content will be removed automatically.

<!-- For more details see the [mathematical proof](/docs/proof.md). -->


#### Organizing Content
For simplicity, the first implementation will follow a simple tagging
pattern. Users can add tags to content that describes the content or
coordinate interests (like [twitter hashtags](https://help.x.com/en/using-x/how-to-use-hashtags)).

Later, SneakerNet may implement [UseNet](https://www.usenetserver.com/what-is-usenet).
Providing an offline mirror of the UseNet forums desired by the local
community. As UseNet is not familiar to most, it is of lower priority to
support on SneakerNet.
