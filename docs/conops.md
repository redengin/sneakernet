Concept of Operations
================================================================================
<!-- main scenario -->
When a person enters into the physical space of a SneakerNet node, they will
be able to access the content stored on that node.

Human Factors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Awareness - user must be made aware that the content is available
    * **primarily** accomplished via the mobile app that automatically
        synchronizes with SneakerNet nodes
    * provide an open wifi connection (attracting those looking for internet
        connectivity)
* Relevance - users want locally relevant content
    * each SneakerNet node's content is maintained by local users - able to
        add and remove content to maximize relevance (curating content)

Roles
================================================================================
* **Author** - content creator
* **Reader** - content consumer
* **Courier** - content distributor/curator

The mobile app unifies the **Reader** and **Courier** roles by automatically
gathering and distributing content during the user's travels. Additionally, the
mobile app updates SneakerNet nodes to the latest firmware revision.


Content Management (Curating Content)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The content of each SneakerNet node is dynamic and curated by **couriers**.

**Couriers** are able to both **add** and **remove** content from a SneakerNet
node. In this way, each SneakerNet node's content reflects the judgement of the
**couriers** in its vicinity.

Mobile app users can flag content for **automatic removal** to increase the
efficiency of content curation.
