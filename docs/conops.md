Concept of Operations
================================================================================
<!-- main scenario -->
When a person enters into the physical space of a `SneakerNet` node, they will
be able to access the content stored on that node.


Human Factors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Awareness - the person must be made aware that the content is available
    * primarily this can be accomplished by an application installed on the
        phone that recognizes `SneakerNet` nodes
    * `SneakerNet` nodes can also publish themselves as a wifi connection
        - attracting those looking for internet connectivity

Ecosystem of `SneakerNet` (Roles)
================================================================================
* Reader - consumer of content
* Courier - carrier of content
    - provides `SneakerNet` content from multiple nodes
* Librarian - determines the content of a node
    - see [content management](content_management)
* Distributor - deploys a physical device under the control of a librarian
* Content Creator - creates content
* Content Publisher - 
    - authorizes content for [content management](content_management)


Content Management<a id="content_management"></a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content is either
* `uncontrolled` - anything goes
* `controlled` - signed by a `Content Publisher`

The librarian is empowered to choose
* to allow `uncontrolled` content
* which `controlled` content publishers to support
