Concept of Operations
================================================================================
<!-- main scenario -->
When a person enters into the physical space of a `SneakerNet` node, they will
be able to access the content stored on that node.


Human Factors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Awareness - the person must be made aware that the content is available
    * primarily this can be accomplished by an application installed on the
        phone that recognizes `SneakerNet` nodes
    * `SneakerNet` nodes can also publish themselves as a wifi connection
        - attracting those looking for internet connectivity

Ecosystem of `SneakerNet` (Roles)
================================================================================
* Reader - consumer of content
* Courier - carrier of content
    - provides `SneakerNet` content from multiple nodes
* Librarian - determines the content of a node
    - [content management](content_management)
* Distributor - deploys a physical device under the control of a librarian
* Content Creator - creates content
    - per [content management](content_management) there may need to be an
        acceptance by a `Content Publisher` for the content to be available.
* Content Publisher - 
    - `sign` content to support [content management](content_management)


Content Management<a id="content_management"></a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content is either
* uncontrolled - anything goes
* controlled - `signed` by a `Content Publisher`

The librarian is empowered to choose
* to allow `uncontrolled` content
* what `controlled` content they wish to make available

As `SneakerNet` is fully distributed, other librarians may provide the content
on their own nodes.

### What authority does the `Content Publisher` have?
None.  
The role of a `content publisher` is to forward content toward an audience.
`Content creators` requesting `signing` simply desire a greater audience.

Anonymity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content is art. Art inspires thought. The individual that produced that content
should be protected in their expression. As a community, one should be focused
on contributing.

A community leverages individual strengths and supports individual weakness. 

`SneakerNet` implementation ensures anonymity to create the opportunities for
individuals to discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
